	<h1>Career highlights</h1>
    <p>Since entering the NBA in 2003, LeBron James has established himself as arguably the second greatest player in basketball history behind only his childhood hero, Michael Jordan. The King has won three NBA championships, three Finals MVPs, four regular-season MVPs and is the only player in NBA history to rank top 10 all-time in points and assists.
	LeBron has played for the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers during his legendary career. The future Hall of Famer has blessed NBA fans with unreal highlight plays over the years.
	With that said, letâ€™s take a look at some of them.
	At 18-years-old, James made his NBA debut with the Cavaliers on October 29, 2003. He finished with 25 points, six rebounds, nine assists and four steals while shooting 12-of-20 from the field against the Sacramento Kings.</p>
