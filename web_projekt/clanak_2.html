				<h3>Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs</h3>
				<h4>Final score - 4(Miami Heat) - 3(Spurs)</h4>
				<p>The 2013 NBA Finals was the championship series of the 2012–13 NBA season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The defending NBA Champion and Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat defeated the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs to win their second straight title. The finals began with Game 1 on June 6, and ended with Game 7 on June 20.</p><br>
				<p>Miami became the sixth team to win consecutive NBA championships, joining the Boston Celtics (1959–1966, 1968–1969), the Los Angeles Lakers (1949–1950, 1952–1954, 1987–1988, 2000–2002, 2009–2010), the Detroit Pistons (1989–1990), the Chicago Bulls (1991–1993, 1996–1998), and the Houston Rockets (1994–1995). This series marked the fifth time the Spurs have made the NBA Finals since 1999, second-most for any franchise in that span behind the Los Angeles Lakers. The Spurs had won all of their previous four finals appearances, putting them only behind the six-time champion Chicago Bulls for most titles without ever losing a Finals, making this series the first Finals loss in Spurs history. This series was also the first time San Antonio had played in the NBA Finals without home court advantage, as Miami had home-court advantage based on their league-best regular season record.[4] It was the Heat's third consecutive NBA Finals appearance, the first Eastern Conference team to achieve that since the Chicago Bulls (1996–1998).</p> <br>This marked the first time a team made three consecutive Finals appearances since the Los Angeles Lakers did so in 2008–2010; since then, only the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers have been able to do so, making five and four consecutive Finals appearances, respectively.
				<p>Four former NBA Finals MVPs played in the series (the Spurs' Tim Duncan and Tony Parker, and the Heat's Dwyane Wade and LeBron James), the most since 1987. The 2013 Finals also set a record for most international players on either Finals roster (10).[6] Tim Duncan became the fourth player in NBA history to make a Finals appearance in three different decades.
				This marked the last NBA Finals played during the tenure of NBA commissioner David Stern. It also marked the last time the Finals used the 2–3–2 format, after which it reverted to the 2–2–1–1–1 format.
				As they were previously close to meeting in the 2005 Finals, the Spurs and Heat would both advance to the 2014 NBA Finals, where the Spurs won in five games.</p><br>
