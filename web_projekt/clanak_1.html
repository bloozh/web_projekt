				<h3>Miami Heat vs Oklahoma City Thunder</h3>
				<h4>Final score - 4(Miami Heat) - 1(OKC)</h4>
				<p>The 2012 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2011–12 season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat defeated the Western Conference champion Oklahoma City Thunder four games to one to win their second NBA title. Heat small forward LeBron James was named the Finals MVP.</p><br>
				<p>This marked the fourth time in franchise history that the Oklahoma City Thunder played in the NBA Finals, and the first time the club played in the NBA Finals since the team (formerly known as the Seattle SuperSonics) relocated from Seattle, Washington to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma prior to the start of the 2008–2009 season. Prior to 2012, the franchise last played in the NBA Finals in 1996 as the SuperSonics, where they lost to the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls, who won a then-NBA record 72 games during that season. The Thunder came into the series as the youngest finalists in NBA history. It also marked the Miami Heat's second consecutive appearance in the NBA Finals and third appearance overall. The Heat previously appeared in 2006 and 2011, both times against the Dirk Nowitzki-led Dallas Mavericks, only to be defeated the previous season.</p><br>
				<p>It was the first (and as of 2020, only) NBA Finals since 1998 that was not held in California or Texas; the 3 teams that won the previous 13 Western Conference titles the Dallas Mavericks, the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs were eliminated by Oklahoma City in that order.
				The series began on June 12, five days later than its originally planned June 7 start. This delay was due to the lockout that pushed the start of the season to late December and shortened the regular season to 66 games.[1] The series then ended on June 21. Under the 2–3–2 rotation, the Thunder had home-court advantage, since they had a better regular season record than the Heat, and thus hosted the first two games. The Heat also became the first team since the 2008–09 Los Angeles Lakers to win the NBA title after losing the previous year, and the first Eastern Conference team to do so since the 1988–89 Detroit Pistons.</p>
